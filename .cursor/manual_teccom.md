•	Edit user profile
After logging in, you can review and edit your personal user data.

2	Registration for the Order Manager with the TecCom ID and password
To register for the Order Manager as an administrator for an organization, you need a TecCom ID and corre- sponding password. With this TecCom ID your organization was created as a customer in the TecAlliance Membership Directory and the TecCom ID is firmly connected to your organization. If you don’t have a Tec- Com ID and password for your organization, then please have an administrator of your organization create a new user for you. You will be invited to the organization via e-mail and then you are able to activate your us- er. Find more information on this in 6.3.1 Create a new user.

The TecCom ID and password for your organization are your "key" for the use of Order Manager and entitles you to the free use of Order Manager.

Please keep your TecCom ID and password in a safe place and protect these credentials against unauthorized access!

You can via the registration process on the login page of Order Manager:
•	create a new user for yourself and register for an organization as an administrator, or
•	register as an existing user to an organization as an administrator. To register as an existing user for an additional organization as an administrator, you can create the new organization also conveniently after you have logged on through the normal process for the Order Manager in the administration.


Please note, that on the registration process you sign in yourself as a user for the Order Manager.


The following describes how to log on as administrator for an organization in the registration process.

•	To access the registration for the Order Manager, use directly this link
https://tecweb.tecalliance.net

•	Click on the login page on the button Register

Figure 1: Registration with the TecCom ID and password on the login page

•	This will take you to a new page on which you can register your organization with the TecCom ID and password in three steps and create for your user in this organization the role of administrator.
 
  Step 1: Entering the TecCom ID and password
•	Please enter the TecCom ID and corresponding password that you received from the TecAlliance sup- port via e-mail.

•	Click on Continue.

Figure 2: Step 1 - Entering the TecCom ID and password

  Step 2: Display of the organization name
•	Once you have registered in the step before with the TecCom ID and the corresponding password and clicked on Continue, you will be forwarded to the second step of the registration.

•	There, the organization name is displayed, which is stored for your TecCom ID at TecAlliance. This is only for information with no input necessary on your part.

If you want to change the organization name, please contact the TecAlliance Support. The support team can change the organization name in our system, which also adjusts the used organization name in Order Manager.


•	Automatic document retrieval:
Do you want to retrieve automatically order responses, dispatch advices and invoices that you receive from suppliers?
When the checkmark is checked, reverse messages are no longer retrieved by TecLocal!

•	Click on Continue.
 

 
Figure 3: Step 2 - Display of the organization name

  Step 3: Create a user as an administrator for the organization
•	In the last step of the registration you create your user as an administrator for the organization that you have previously selected with the TecCom ID and password.

•	Here we have to distinguish between two cases:
If you do not have an own Order Manager user, please follow the instructions in 2.3.1 Registration as a new Order Manager user

If you already have an own Order Manager user, please follow the instructions in 2.3.2 Registration with an existing Order Manager user.

  Registration as a new Order Manager user
Only if you do not have a Order Manager user yet, you must go through the following steps. No Order Man- ager user means that you started working with the Order Manager for the first time and have not previously registered with your e-mail address in the Order Manager or your Order Manager user has been deleted.

•	Select the checkbox New User.

Retype e-mail:	Repeat the entry of your e-mail address. To avoid a wrong entry of the email address, for example by typos, no copy & paste is allowed for this field. The registration can only be completed successfully if you then activate your e- mail address through the registration confirmation e-mail.

After you have created your password, your user is activated and you are able to log in with your e-mail address and password on the login page of the Order Manager. You will then be created as an administrator for the organization SIT_B_QUA_TF_54789_Test-SMA. Find the organization in your organization list and edit it there. If you have not received an e-mail, please repeat the registration or contact your system administrator.

•	Please close this browser window, because it is for information only.


•	You will receive a "registration confirmation e-mail" to the e-mail address you registered with earlier.
 
Should you not have received an e-mail to confirm your e-mail address in your inbox, please check if the e-mail ended up in your spam folder.

Should you accidentally have entered the incorrect e-mail during the registration process, please repeat the steps of the registration as described in, 2.3.1 Registration as a new Order Manager user


•	Please open the "registration confirmation e-mail" and click on the link in the e-mail.

•	You are automatically redirected to the registration confirmation page in a new browser window.

Please note that the link is only active for 96 hours and you have to activate your user within this time via the link. If you do not use the link within the 96-hour period, you have to repeat the regis- tration steps.

Figure 5: Activating your user entering a secure password

•	On the registration confirmation page you can activate your new user, through creating a personal pass- word for your user.

•	Enter your password in the Password field and repeat the password in the field Retype password. The entry in both fields must be identical and cannot be done with Copy & Paste.


Please note that your password must be at least 8 characters and satisfy at least 3 of the fol- lowing requirements:

The password must contain lowercase letters The password must contain uppercase letters The password must contain a number from 0 to 9 password must contain special characters
 
•	With the display of a colored bar below the password field you can see whether the password corre- sponds to the complexity requirements of Order Manager or not:
Red:	The password requirements are not met. You cannot use or save this password for your Order Manager user.
Yellow:	The minimum requirements for password complexity are met. You can use and store this password for your Order Manager user. To make your password more secure, we rec- ommend to fulfill a further requirement criterion from the list.
Green:	The requirements of your user password are completely fulfilled and your password is considered safe. You can use and store this password for your user.

•	Save your password with Save. You will receive an information message on the browser displaying that your password has been successfully saved.

•	To log in on the Order Manager, go through <Back to Login on the registration confirmation page to the login page.

•	You can now log in to Order Manager through the login page with your user data.


  Registration with an existing Order Manager user
If you already have an existing Order Manager user, you can register directly with this user for the new or- ganization through the registration process on the login page.

Alternatively to register for an additional organization in the registration process, you can create an organiza- tion after the normal login process in Order Manager in Administration  Organization. Thus, you will be automatically created as an administrator for the organization. See more in 6.2.1 Create a new organization in administration.

Do you rather wish to register an additional organization through the registration process, then proceed as described below:

•	Once you have previously entered your TecCom ID + password in the first step, saw the organization name in the second step and arrived through Next to the third step of the setup wizard, click then on the checkbox Existing User.

4	Useful settings and information
In the following section you will find a description of useful general functions and information regarding Order Manager.
The general settings can help you to adapt the Order Manager to your individual needs. Therefore you have the possibility within the menu items of Request & Order, Journal and Administration to:
•	configure the displayed columns in the list display individually
•	individually configure the number of line items displayed per page
•	as well as to save the individual display settings permanently
You can use the Order Manager on variable devices through the responsive design. You will also find information for the following topics:
•	organization selection for multi-organizational settings
•	definitions of request, express order and stock order

  Individual display settings in Order Manager
You have the possibility to adjust and save your individual display settings in Order Manager according to your preference.

Figure 9: Custom display settings

For the sections:
•	Request & Order	 New request or order / Manager
•	Journal	 Outbound / Received
•	Administration	 Organizations / User / Ship-to / Partners
you can individually define the columns displayed and the number of entries displayed. These settings are either temporarily valid or can be saved permanently with Save view.

  Selection of displayed columns
If you click on Columns, you get a list with a selection of possible columns displayed on the page. If you like to compile your individual column display, please uncheck Default and select the respective check box for the columns that should be displayed.

If a column is marked with a check mark in the corresponding checkbox, the column is displayed. If no check mark is set, the column is not displayed. If you want to reset your individual columns display, then select the checkbox for Default. This will reset your customized columns view and only display the default columns.

  Selecting the number of entries displayed per page
You can define for each page individually the number of rows displayed per page. To do this, select in the list the desired number of rows. The display instantly adapts to your selection.
 

TIP: Read the total number of entries
You can see the total number of rows below the displayed results. The total number is highlighted with blue color and you can also immediately see how many results are displayed per page.

If the total number of rows exceeds the display on a page, you can either increase the number of rows dis- played per page accordingly, as described in 4.1.2 Selecting the number of entries displayed per page or you switch with the arrows below the items to the next page.

  Permanent saving of the individual display settings
You can save your individual settings for the page permanently by pressing Save view. Your settings are thereby saved even after leaving the page or the session. By loading the page again, you can find your indi- vidual display settings preset accordingly and adapted to your needs.
  Organization selection in Order Manager
You can switch between multiple organizations in Order Manager, without having to log off and in again. The requirement for this is that your user has various organizations assigned to him in the master data.
To switch between the assigned organizations, you can select the desired organization on the top right in the combo box next to your user e-mail address. All entries will be displayed according to the selected organization.

Figure 10: Organization selection for multi-organizations


The last selected organization is selected automatically again at the next log in.

  Definition of business processes
The following information provides a brief overview of the business processes that can be mapped.


  Request
Requests are not binding and are for information only. A request does not imply any material reservation with the supplier.

Number of items:
The number of inquiry items is not limited but it is recommended to limit the number at 1000.

Returned information:
•	Availability		Indication on whether the desired item is in stock in the requested amount. The purchaser can specify both for the individual order item as well as for the entire or- der, whether he agrees with partial deliveries or wishes a complete delivery. A sup- plier may waive statements of availability.
•	Prices	It‘s about either list or customer-specific prices. Optionally, a supplier may waive the display of prices.
•	Description	Checking of the product number and short text for the ordered part. This text
serves the customer to compare if the ordered product number belongs to the desired part.
 
•	Information on alternative parts (depending on the supplier, this means an alternative part is a func- tionally identical part from another manufacturer or a replacement part of the same manufacturer)
•	Information when the desired parts cannot be ordered at the supplier (defective part numbers or missing parts). What information is returned, is dependent on the specific implementation of the ERP system (enterprise resource planning system) and also depends on the configuration of the supplier system.

  Express orders
Express orders are time-critical and are carried out without backorder or delivery schedules ("schedule lines"). The response to an express order is the same as an order confirmation and the supplier confirms on- ly the quantity that can actually be delivered based on the selected shipping method and the associated de- livery.

Number of items:
The number of order items is not limited, but it is recommended to restrict the number to a maximum of 1000.

Returned information:
•	For express orders the same information as in request is returned about availability, prices, descrip- tions, alternative parts and errors.
•	If possible, the customer will receive an order or document number, to have a reference when con- tacting the supplier.
•	If the supplier has carried out the availability check as described above, the customer may equate the returned information of the order confirmation to a delivery notice.
The buyer may assume that the as available reported positions will be delivered to the specified date.

  Stock orders
Stock orders are not time critical, they serve e.g. for the routine filling of the warehouse of an orderer. Stock orders are processed on the supplier side with backlog and schedule lines. A delivery date possibly specified by the orderer is not binding (requested delivery date), the delivery can also be after this date.

Number of order items:
The number of order items in a stock order is not limited, but it is recommended to limit the number to a max- imum of 1000.

Returned Information:
•	For stock orders the inquiry functionality is carried out only partially.
•	There is no availability information returned, relating to the requested delivery date
•	Whether the price information is returned depends on which data processing is selected for stock orders.
•	For not valid item numbers error messages are returned.
•	No information on delivery date is returned (not even in the case of graduations)
•	If possible, the customer will receive an order number, to refer to his order with the supplier.

  e-Invoicing (TecInvoice) in Order Manager
e-Invoicing is the TecAlliance Solution that allows suppliers to deliver legally valid electronic invoices to their invoice recipients.

As invoice recipient you can now receive and view the electronic invoices in Order Manager. In addition to the current options to receive electronic invoices, i.e. via email, Web Service (PullClient, TOMConnect) or
 
BillPresentment Portal, you have now the possibility to receive electronic invoices with the same tool that you use to order. The invoices are provided in a separate “e-Invoices” journal of the Order Manager.
The e-Invoices journal shows the most important data of your invoices at a glance without the need to open the invoice documents. You can sort, search and filter the invoices using different criteria similar to the other Order Manager journals. You can view and download the invoices and corresponding documents like struc- tured data, electronic signature, verification report or index file.

The following shows a screenshot of the new e-Invoices journal in Order Manager for legally valid invoices that are sent via the e-Invoicing (TecInvoice) Service:
 
Figure 11: e-Invoices journal

What needs to be done when you want to receive invoices in Order Manager?

1.	You already receive invoices from your supplier via the e-Invoicing (TecInvoice) service:

a.	Please inform TecAlliance Support, that you want to receive electronic invoices in Order Manager. TecAlliance support will provide the necessary configuration. They will need the TecCom ID of your organization where you want to view your invoices.

Note for TecInvoice PullClient users: Currently it is not possible that you receive invoices in PullClient and in Order Manager in parallel. If you want to receive invoices in Order Manager please stop the
PullClient service. Invoices that have already been pulled will not be available for a second down- load, i.e. if a PullClient pulled invoices they cannot be downloaded again by Order Manager.

b.	The organization under which you want to view the invoices must get in Order Manager the right to download invoices form the TecInvoice service. The administrator must therefore activate Download e-Invoices under Administration/Organization. If the function is activated the invoices are pulled from the TecInvoice service and stored in Order Manager according the configured journal storage duration.

Note: When the administrator activates Download e-Invoices Order Manager starts a request to the TecInvoice service and checks whether the TecInvoice configuration needed for the download of
e-Invoices is available. If an error message is displayed the configuration is missing you should con- tact TecAlliance support (see a).
 
2.	If you do not yet receive invoices from your supplier via the e-Invoicing (TecInvoice) service please con- tact your supplier.

Further information about the e-Invoices Journal you can find in section 8.5.

•	IFD Settings:	Here you can configure the IFD Import.
•	Organizations:	You can see your assigned organizations in the organization list. In addition, as administrator you can create new organizations for your user or edit your organiza- tions.

Below is a detailed explanation of the individual submenu items of Administration and all available functions are presented.

  IFD Settings
Here you have the possibility to store format description files (IFD files) for a maximum of two ERP systems and catalogs. If IFD files are stored, users of the organization can upload orders with multiple line items to the shopping cart.

Note that IFD files for ERP and catalogs differ in the structure.

Figure 13: IFD Settings


IFD sample and order files are provided as templates in the IFD settings. You can use our IFD sample files as a template for your own format description file. Just download a suitable file and adapt it to your needs us- ing the IFD instructions.
 
  Organizations
In the menu item Administration  Organizations you can see your assigned organizations in the organi- zations list. For each of your organizations you see your user role in the respective organization. You can al- so delete organizations and remove yourself from assigned organizations. But if you are the last administra- tor of an organization and remove yourself from the assigned organization, then you delete this organization completely and remove the relationship of other users to this organization.

Under Organizations, you can for organizations in which you have the role of Administrator:
•	view and edit the users of the organization
•	update the organization data on the TecAlliance Platform
•	change the organization password

As administrator you can create new organizations in Order Manager. Thereby you are automatically admin- istrator for this new organization. Afterwards you can assign more users to the newly created organization.

In organization details you have the option for this organization to define the organization color and journal storage time, as well as (dis-) enable the download of reverse messages. If checked, the reverse messages will be stored directly in Order Manager (and not in TecLocal). If the checkbox is not checked, the reverse messages are stored for example in your local TecLocal installation.

You also have the option to activate Download e-Invoices which activates the download of legally valid in- voices from the e-Invoicing (TecInvoice) service.
If Download e-Invoices is checked Order Manager starts a request to the TecInvoice service and verifies whether the TecInvoice configuration needed for the download of e-Invoices is available. If an error message is displayed the configuration is missing and you should contact TecAlliance support if not already done (see section 4.3.4).
 

 
Figure 14: Administration of Organizations

  Creating a new organization
To create a new organization, you need a TecCom ID and the corresponding password of the organization. The TecCom ID and password are the identification of your organization at TecAlliance. These are available after setting up the organization on the TecAlliance platform and sent out to you by the TecAlliance support via e-mail.

If you have the role administrator, you can in Administration  Organizations by clicking on Add Organi- zation create a new organization, after you have logged in to Order Manager through the normal registration process.

If you are not an administrator and can't see the Administration and button Add Organization, please use the registration process on the login page. This allows you also to create a new organization and become the administrator of the organization, even if you have not yet had the role administrator.

•	Go to Administration  Organizations and click on Add Organization

•	This opens a setup wizard, from which you can create a new organization in two steps and add yourself automatically as an administrator.
 
6.2.1.1	Step 1 – Entering the TecCom ID and password
Figure 15: Step 1 - creating a new organization


•	Please enter the TecCom ID and corresponding password that you received from the TecAlliance sup- port via e-mail.
TecCom ID:	The TecCom ID is already filled in some places. You only have to edit the following places of the TecCom ID:
On the third place of the TecCom ID, you can select the correct combination of numbers according to your TecCom ID via a drop-down list.
On the fifth place of the TecCom ID enter the nine-digit number according to your TecCom ID. Leading zeros are added automatically as soon as the button Continue is pressed.
Password:	Enter the password corresponding to your TecCom ID, which you received along with your TecCom ID via e-mail from the TecAlliance Support.

•	Click on Next

If you don’t want to create a new organization and leave the setup wizard prematurely, then click on the Cancel symbol   on the top right of the setup wizard. You return to the organization list and no organization was created.
 
6.2.1.2	Step 2 - Display of the organization name
•	Once you have registered in the step before with the TecCom ID and the corresponding password and clicked on Continue, you will be forwarded to the second step of the registration.

•	There, the organization name is displayed, which is stored for your TecCom ID at TecAlliance. This is only for information with no input necessary on your part.

If you want to change the organization name, please contact the TecAlliance Support. The support team can change the organization name in our system, which also adjusts the used organization name in Order Manager.

•	Click on Finish to create a new organization and add yourself as an administrator. You can find the new organization in your organization list and are now able to add additional users to this organization.

If you don’t want to create a new organization and leave the setup wizard prematurely, then click on the Cancel symbol   on the top right of the setup wizard. You return to the organization list and no organization was created.

Figure 16: Step 2 - display of the organization name

  Deleting an existing organization
Please consider strongly the following three characteristics:

1.	Deleting your last assigned organization will also delete your user, because you must have at least one assigned organization.
2.	If you are an administrator and delete an organization in which you are the last administrator, then the organization will also be removed from all other users of the organization, since an organization always has to have at least one administrator.
3.	If you were the last administrator of an organization and delete the organization from your assigned organizations and thus also for the other users of the organization, then users of the deleted organi- zation who are not assigned to further organizations will also be deleted.

To delete an existing organization, please go to Administration  Organizations and select the corre- sponding organization in your organization list. Then click on Delete.

If you delete an existing organization through Delete in Administration  Organizations, then the selected organization is removed from your assigned organizations and you can:
•	no longer see the organization in your organization list
•	not see and edit any data of the organization
•	not see and edit any journal entries of the organization
•	not do any request and orders for the deleted organization

If you want to delete the organization from your assigned organizations, confirm with Yes in the message or return to the menu with No, without finishing the deletion process.
 
An incorrect deletion of an organization can only be remedied by creating the organization again. Find a de- scription on how to create a new organization under 6.2.1 Creating Creating a new organization. The journal entries and your shopping carts are no longer displayed.

  Creating an organization (change organization password)
If your organization password has changed, then you must also update it in Order Manager for your organi- zation.

Click on the button Setup and it opens an input mask. Fill in the fields old password for your original pass- word and in the password field the new password of the organization and repeat the password in the field confirm password.

ATTENTION: Please note that with this function you change the organization password and not your own user password!

Save the new password by clicking Save. If you don't want to change the password of the organization, then click Cancel.

There are two ways for creating a favorite. You can either, create and save a shopping cart first, then convert it to a favorite, or save it directly.

These favorites are made available to other users through the "public" function. These templates can be re- vised or used directly for the creation and saving of public shopping carts. There is also the possibility to cre- ate private shopping carts from public templates.

From a saved template you can create an infinite amount of shopping carts.


After sending out a shopping cart (order), it is deleted from the shopping cart manager. The favorite template, on the other hand, is still stored after sending a shopping cart and is not deleted until it is deleted manually from the list.

8	Journal
Under the menu Journal you see all your sent requests and orders, as well as all received documents re- garding your orders and received e-invoices.

In the list view of the journal entries you quickly get an overview of your orders and documents. The journal entries are structured after the following submenu items:
•	Outbound
•	Received
•	e-Invoices (for legally valid electronic invoices)


You see in the menu items through the icons, the type and status of your orders / documents and you are al- so able to check the time stamp as well as the customer name.
By clicking on the respective row in the journal entry, you open more details regarding the selected entry, be- low the list view. Through the tabs in the details you get more detailed information for the selected entry.
If you want to switch to the item level or view a document, you can do it quickly from the detailed view.


Tip: Navigation with the keyboard
Within the list view of the journal entries, there is a very convenient way to navigate with the keyboard, using the Up / Down keys to scroll through the individual entries. If you have selected a journal entry, you switch with the Right key button quickly to the item level or the document view.

Cloud integration

 	If a cloud is connected, Order Manager will in a regular interval, automatically copy and download the journal entries to the cloud, even when no user is logged in. The journal interface for received and outbound has been extended with an Exported column, which is shown by default and hidden through the Columns option. The column shows
3 possible icons (exported, downloaded, exported & downloaded).

  Filter and search in the journal (outbound / received / e-Invoices)
For journal entries in outbound and received you have the possibility to customize your filter options for the list view. Custom filter settings are saved for the current session. To delete an individual filter setting, use Reset filter in the filter criteria.

  General filter options in journal
In the list view of the journal entries you find in the upper left the possible filter options. By clicking on the de- sired filter option the displayed journal entries are filtered accordingly.
•	Click the filter option Today and you get only journal entries of today's date.
•	Click the filter option 7 days and you get only journal entries from the last 7 days including today's date.
•	Click the filter option 30 days and you get only journal entries of the last 30 days including today's date.

Additionally, you are able to set additional custom filter options for journal entries by clicking on More filter criteria.

Figure 54: More filter criteria


In the individual tabs of the More filter criteria options you can for example:
•	Set individually the displayed filter period
•	Filter by single operation types
•	Filter according to a different status
•	Search with different classification criteria for a specific journal entry

If you want to apply the selected filter options of the More filter criteria to the list view, click on Apply. If you want to leave without applying the filter options and return to the list view, click on Cancel.
You delete all filter options with Reset filter and return to the default filter settings.
 
Tip: Set multiple filter options at once
In More filter criteria you switch between the tabs back and forth and set your filter options. Only after you have set all the needed filter options, click on Apply. This applies all filter options from all tabs at once.
You can also apply the filters Today, 7 days and 30 days in combination with the other filtering options. The filters Today, 7 days and 30 days overrule the selected filter period from More filter criteria.

Tip: Recognizing that an individual filter is set
The individual filter settings are saved in the current session. If the filter icon   is displayed next to More fil- ter criteria, you immediately see that custom filter settings are applied. Resetting the filter settings in More filter criteria by clicking on Reset filter, can help you to find a desired journal entry that was not shown be- cause of the individual filter settings.

  Detailed search in the list view
If you want to browse in a certain column, enter in the detailed search above the header of the column the desired filter term.

The Detailed search is available only for the display of up to 1000 journal entries in the list view. If more items appear in the list view, the detailed search cannot be used. You then see the text "The detailed search is disabled because the number of results exceeds the limit", instead of the detailed search.

Tip: Sorting of columns
In addition to the general filtering option and detailed search in the list view, you have the option in each col- umn to sort in ascending or descending order. Just click on the arrow in the respective column header.

  General functions in the journal (outbound / received / e-Invoices)
The general functions of the journal described below are available in both of the menu items outbound and received and are therefore only explained once.

  Updating journal entries
To update the displayed journal entries click on Refresh. The journal entries are thereby updated.
