Design and Implementation of a Technological Solution for an Online Store
Project Objectives
•	Implement a CRM for an Online Store: Develop a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system tailored for an e-commerce platform. The CRM will facilitate order management, integrating seamlessly with the online store's sales process. It will track customer orders from creation to fulfillment, including status updates and history.
•	Supplier Integration (Inspired by TecCom): Incorporate supplier management and integration features inspired by TecCom’s functionalities. This means enabling near real-time stock inquiries and automated order communication with suppliers (e.g. sending purchase orders or drop-ship requests) to reduce manual effort. The goal is to “reduce handling time significantly, make availability enquiries in near real-time and increase security through immediate order confirmations”
tecalliance.net
, similar to what TecCom’s platform achieves.
•	Multi-User Access (Team and Customers): Provide role-based access for different user types. Store team members (admin/staff users) will have an interface to manage products, orders, and suppliers through the CRM. Customers will have a portal to view their orders, update their profile, and potentially place or track orders. This ensures both internal staff and customers can interact with the system appropriately, improving transparency and service.
Scope and Core Deliverables
The project will deliver a web-based CRM application (built with Laravel Sail) that encompasses the following core features:
•	Customer Management: Manage customer accounts and information. Admin users can view and edit customer profiles, see order history, and handle customer-related tasks (e.g., resolving issues or updating details). Customers can update their own profile and view their order status/history via a self-service dashboard.
•	Product Management: Maintain a catalog of products sold in the online store. This includes CRUD operations for products (create, read/list, update, delete), managing product details (name, description, price, stock level, etc.), and linking each product to a supplier for restock or drop-shipping purposes.
•	Order Management: A comprehensive order module to handle customer orders. Features include creating new orders (when customers check out), viewing order details, updating order status (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered, canceled), and handling order fulfillment. The system will allow admins to see all orders and filter by status or customer, while customers can see their own orders. Order management will also incorporate generation of order items (line items for each product in an order) and calculations of totals.
•	Supplier Synchronization & Integration: Tools to integrate with suppliers, inspired by TecCom. This includes maintaining a Suppliers directory (with supplier info and API endpoints if available), and synchronizing relevant data:
o	Ability to query supplier inventory or pricing for products (e.g., via scheduled sync jobs or on-demand queries) so the CRM has up-to-date stock info.
o	When an order is placed, automatically notify or send an order request to the corresponding supplier(s). For example, if products are drop-shipped, the system could send an order to the supplier via API or email.
o	Possibly import order confirmations or tracking numbers from suppliers back into the CRM, similar to TecCom’s immediate confirmation mechanism.
•	User Roles and Permissions: The system will distinguish between admin (staff) users and customer users. Admins have access to management screens for products, orders, suppliers, and all customers. Customers have access only to their dashboard (profile, their orders). This will be enforced via authentication and middleware so that, for example, only admins can access routes like product creation or supplier management.
All the above features will be delivered as a cohesive Laravel application. Next, we outline the technical implementation details for each component of the system.
Technical Implementation Plan
1. Sail Laravel Setup
Why Laravel Sail: We will use Laravel Sail to set up the development environment. Laravel Sail is an official lightweight command-line interface for Docker that provides a ready-to-use Docker environment (PHP, MySQL, Redis, etc.) for Laravel
laravel.com
. This allows consistent development setups without requiring deep Docker knowledge.
Initial Laravel Installation: To create a new Laravel project configured for Sail, we can use the one-line installer. For example, run the following in a terminal (replacing crm-project with your desired project name):
bash
CopyEdit
# Using the Laravel Sail installer script to create a new project
curl -s "https://laravel.build/crm-project" | bash

# After the script runs, move into the project directory
cd crm-project

# Start the Docker containers (Laravel app, MySQL, etc.)
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
This will create a new Laravel application in a crm-project folder and start it in detached (-d) mode. The Sail script sets up a docker-compose.yml with services like mysql for the database and configures the environment. (If the developer already has a Laravel app, they could instead run composer require laravel/sail --dev and php artisan sail:install to add Sail to an existing project
laravel.com

laravel.com
.)
Docker & .env Configuration: Once Sail is running, Laravel will be served at http://localhost (or a specified port). We need to configure environment variables in the .env file for database connection and other services:
•	Sail’s default .env will set DB_HOST=mysql, DB_PORT=3306, DB_DATABASE=laravel, DB_USERNAME=sail, DB_PASSWORD=password (these are the default credentials Sail uses for the MySQL container). We can adjust these if needed, but the defaults suffice for development.
•	Ensure the APP_URL is set (e.g., APP_URL=http://localhost) so that services like Laravel’s authentication and Dusk tests know the correct URL.
•	Mail and other service credentials can be set up here as well if needed (for example, SMTP details for sending order notifications).
Authentication Scaffolding: To expedite development of login/registration and basic UI, we will install a Laravel starter kit. We have two popular options:
•	Laravel Breeze: a lightweight starter kit that implements all basic auth features (user registration, login, password reset, email verification) with simple Blade templates
laravel.com
. Breeze is minimal and easy to customize.
•	Laravel Jetstream: a more advanced starter kit that includes additional features like team accounts, API tokens, and uses either Livewire or Inertia for frontend.
For this project, Laravel Breeze is a good choice due to its simplicity and Blade-based default implementation. We will install Breeze via Sail:
bash
CopyEdit
# Require the Breeze package
./vendor/bin/sail composer require laravel/breeze --dev

# Install Breeze scaffold (will prompt for frontend stack, we choose Blade)
./vendor/bin/sail artisan breeze:install

# Run migrations to create default tables (users, password resets, etc.)
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate

# Install NPM dependencies and compile assets (if Breeze includes frontend assets)
./vendor/bin/sail npm install
./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev
After this, the application will have ready-made authentication pages and an example home/dashboard page. Breeze provides “a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's authentication features, including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and a simple profile page”
laravel.com
. This gives us a foundation for user accounts (both admins and customers will use the same login system). We will likely extend the default users table (from Breeze’s migration) to include a role (e.g., an is_admin boolean or role enum) to distinguish admin vs customer users.
At this point, the Laravel application structure is set up with Sail (Docker containers running PHP and MySQL), and we have authentication ready. Next, we proceed to define the database schema for our CRM features.
2. Database Configuration
We will use Laravel’s migration system to create the database schema. The core tables needed for the CRM system are: users, products, orders, order_items, and suppliers. Each corresponds to an Eloquent model and has relationships as described below.
Migration Files and Schema Design:
•	Users: (already created by the auth scaffold) stores user accounts. Fields include id, name, email, password, email_verified_at, timestamps. We will modify or extend this table to include a role or is_admin field (e.g., a boolean flag or string role). This allows differentiating between store staff and customers.
(Relationship: a user can place many orders, i.e., one-to-many with orders.)*
•	Products: stores products sold in the store. Key fields: id, name, description, price (numeric), stock (integer stock level), supplier_id (foreign key to Suppliers), and timestamps. We may also include fields like SKU or category if needed.
(Relationship: a product belongs to one supplier; a product can appear in many order items.)*
•	Suppliers: stores supplier information. Fields: id, name (supplier company name), contact_info (could be a JSON or separate fields for email, phone), maybe api_endpoint or credentials if integration is via API, etc., plus timestamps.
(Relationship: a supplier can supply many products.)*
•	Orders: represents customer orders. Fields: id, user_id (foreign key to Users, indicating the customer who placed the order), order_date, status (e.g., pending, confirmed, shipped, completed, canceled), and possibly total_amount. We might also include shipping_address or reference to an address if needed, or a simple address field. Timestamps for when the order record was created/updated are included by default.
(Relationship: an order belongs to one user (customer); an order can contain many order items. If each order was associated with a single supplier (e.g., in a purchase order scenario), we could have a supplier_id here, but since a customer order may include items from multiple suppliers, we will not have a direct supplier_id in orders. Instead, the link to suppliers is through each product in the order’s items. This design supports orders with multiple suppliers.)*
•	Order Items: line items for orders, linking products to an order with quantity. Fields: id, order_id (foreign key to Orders), product_id (foreign key to Products), quantity, unit_price (price at the time for that product, to record historical price), maybe subtotal (or can be calculated as quantity * unit_price). This table allows a many-to-many relationship between orders and products (since an order can have many products, and a product can be in many orders).
(Relationship: order item belongs to an order and to a product. Through order_items, an order has many products (many-to-many), and a product appears in many orders.)*
Each migration will use Laravel’s Schema builder. For example, the migration for orders might look like:
php
CopyEdit
Schema::create('orders', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->onDelete('cascade');  // references users.id
    // $table->foreignId('supplier_id')->nullable()->constrained();   // (optional, if each order tied to one supplier)
    $table->dateTime('order_date')->default(DB::raw('CURRENT_TIMESTAMP'));
    $table->string('status')->default('pending');
    $table->decimal('total_amount', 10, 2)->nullable();
    $table->timestamps();
});
Other migrations will be similar, creating foreign keys accordingly:
•	In products table: $table->foreignId('supplier_id')->constrained(); which references suppliers.id.
•	In order_items table: foreign keys for order_id and product_id with constrained() to enforce integrity.
•	If using is_admin in users: $table->boolean('is_admin')->default(false); (or a string role field).
After writing the migration classes (e.g., create_products_table, create_suppliers_table, etc.), we run ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate to apply them and generate the tables in MySQL. The result is a relational database with all necessary tables and foreign key constraints. We now have the structure to store our CRM data.
3. Model Creation
For each database table, we will create a corresponding Eloquent Model in Laravel, which will handle ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for that table. These models define relationships to each other using Laravel’s expressive syntax for relations (hasMany, belongsTo, etc.). The core models and their relationships are:
•	User model (User.php): Already generated by Laravel. We will ensure it has a relation orders() defined as:
php
CopyEdit
class User extends Model {
    // ...
    public function orders() {
        return $this->hasMany(Order::class);
    }
}
This means one user can have many orders (for customers placing multiple orders). We might also add helper scopes or attributes, for example isAdmin() to check the role.
•	Product model (Product.php): Defines that a product belongs to a supplier and has many order items. For example:
php
CopyEdit
class Product extends Model {
    public function supplier() {
        return $this->belongsTo(Supplier::class);
    }
    public function orderItems() {
        return $this->hasMany(OrderItem::class);
    }
    // (Optional convenience: many-to-many relationship to orders through order_items)
    public function orders() {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Order::class, 'order_items')
                    ->withPivot('quantity', 'unit_price');
    }
}
Here, orders() uses belongsToMany to directly get all orders that include this product, via the pivot table order_items. The withPivot call ensures we can access the quantity and price on the pivot.
•	Supplier model (Supplier.php): Defines that a supplier can have many products:
php
CopyEdit
class Supplier extends Model {
    public function products() {
        return $this->hasMany(Product::class);
    }
    // (Optional: If we consider each Order might be associated with one supplier, we could have:
    // public function orders() { return $this->hasMany(Order::class); }
    // But in our design, orders link to suppliers through products.)
}
The supplier may also have methods to integrate (e.g., API calls) but those would be in service classes rather than the model.
•	Order model (Order.php): Defines relationships to user, order items, and products:
php
CopyEdit
class Order extends Model {
    public function user() {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }
    public function orderItems() {
        return $this->hasMany(OrderItem::class);
    }
    public function products() {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Product::class, 'order_items')
                    ->withPivot('quantity', 'unit_price');
    }
    // If we had a supplier_id in orders:
    // public function supplier() { return $this->belongsTo(Supplier::class); }
}
The products() relation (many-to-many via order_items) provides an easy way to access all products in an order. We will typically use orderItems to get quantity and price details for each product in an order.
•	OrderItem model (OrderItem.php): Defines inverse relations back to order and product:
php
CopyEdit
class OrderItem extends Model {
    public function order() {
        return $this->belongsTo(Order::class);
    }
    public function product() {
        return $this->belongsTo(Product::class);
    }
}
All models will use Laravel’s defaults (timestamps, fillable fields or guarded as needed). We will also leverage Eloquent events or observers if needed (for example, to automatically update an order total when order items are added, or to trigger an event when an Order is created to notify the supplier).
By defining these relationships, we enable convenient data access patterns. For instance, we can load a user’s orders and each order’s items and product info easily with Eloquent. This forms the backbone for our controllers.
4. Controller Development
We will implement RESTful controllers for the major resources: Product, Order, Supplier, and Customer (or User). Each controller will handle the CRUD operations and business logic for its resource, using Laravel’s features like request validation and Eloquent ORM. Below is the plan for each:
•	ProductController: Handles product management.
o	Methods:
	index() – List all products (for admins, possibly with pagination and search).
	create() – Show a form for adding a new product.
	store() – Validate and save a new product to the database.
	edit($id) – Show edit form for an existing product.
	update($id) – Validate and update product details.
	destroy($id) – Delete a product (perhaps with checks if not in any pending orders).
o	Business logic: for example, when creating or updating a product, ensure required fields are present, and maybe log an activity. If integrating with supplier data, when a product is created, we might fetch initial stock or details from the supplier’s system.
Code Example – Storing a Product:
php
CopyEdit
// In ProductController.php
public function store(Request $request) {
    $validated = $request->validate([
        'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
        'price' => 'required|numeric',
        'supplier_id' => 'required|exists:suppliers,id',
        // ... other validations
    ]);
    $product = Product::create($validated);
    // Optionally, sync with supplier or trigger an event.
    return redirect()->route('products.index')
                     ->with('success', 'Product created successfully.');
}
This uses mass assignment to create the product (we will ensure $fillable is set in the Product model for these fields).
•	OrderController: Handles order listing and processing.
o	Methods:
	index() – For admins: list all orders with filters (by status, by customer). For customers: list their orders. We may implement this by checking the authenticated user’s role: if admin, show all; if customer, filter where user_id = auth()->id().
	show($id) – Display details of a single order. This will include order items and related product info. Admins can view any order; customers can only view their own.
	create() – (Optional, if admins manually create orders for customers via backend, or for phone orders, etc. In a typical scenario, customers place orders via the store front-end, so this might not be heavily used in CRM except for creating manual orders.)
	store() – (Optional for the same reason as create; could be used for admin to create an order on behalf of a customer.)
	edit/update() – Update order status or details. For example, an admin might update an order’s status (e.g., mark as shipped, add a tracking number). Customers generally wouldn’t edit orders, except maybe to cancel if not shipped.
	destroy() – Possibly allow deleting/canceling an order (cancellation could be its own action, but a soft delete or status change is safer than hard delete).
o	Business logic: The OrderController is key for integrating with suppliers. For instance, when a new order is stored (customer checkout or admin creation), after saving the Order and OrderItems, we could trigger an integration:
	For each supplier involved (e.g., for each unique supplier_id in the order’s items), send an order request to that supplier. This could be done via an API call if the supplier provides one (perhaps implemented via a separate service class or a queued job for reliability).
	If the supplier responds with confirmation (order accepted, maybe an expected delivery date or confirmation number), record that in our Order model (could store a supplier order ID or status).
	Handle cases where supplier reports an item out of stock – maybe update the order status to on-hold and notify the customer.
	The TecCom inspiration comes in here: ideally, automate as much of the supplier communication as possible (real-time availability check and immediate confirmation)
tecalliance.net
. This might be beyond basic Laravel, but our design would allow integrating such API calls in the controller or service layer.
o	We will also implement logic for OrderController to ensure authorization: only admins or the owner of the order can perform certain actions.
•	SupplierController: Manages suppliers.
o	Methods:
	index() – List all suppliers (admin only).
	create()/store() – Add a new supplier (with details like name and contact info, possibly API credentials).
	edit()/update() – Update supplier information.
	show($id) – (Optional) View details about a supplier, possibly including all products or orders associated with them.
	destroy() – Remove a supplier (if no products or safe to remove).
o	Business logic: Could include initiating sync. For example, a button or action to "Sync products" for a supplier that triggers a job to import or update product data from that supplier’s feed. The controller might call a service that handles this import.
•	CustomerController (UserController): Manage customer accounts (admin side) or allow a customer to view/edit their profile.
o	For admin/staff:
	index() – List all customers (all users with customer role).
	show($id) – View a particular customer's profile and order history.
	Possibly edit/update() – if admins need to update customer info or assign roles.
o	For the customer (self-service):
	We might not need a full controller; instead, customers can edit their profile via the UI provided by Breeze (Breeze’s profile blade or we can create a simple form).
	The customer’s order list is handled by OrderController (filtered by their user_id).
o	We will likely use a form request or simply reuse the default Laravel user update logic for profile updates (name, email, password).
Each controller method will be unit-tested (feature tests) to ensure it performs the correct actions. We’ll also implement form validation (using Laravel’s validate method or custom FormRequest classes) to ensure data integrity (e.g., no negative prices, required fields present, etc.).
Note on Authorization: We will utilize Laravel’s authorization to ensure security:
•	Use middleware to ensure only authenticated users access these controllers.
•	Use gates or policies or simple condition checks for specific actions (e.g., in OrderController@show, ensure auth()->id == $order->user_id for customer or auth()->user->is_admin).
•	Possibly create a custom isAdmin middleware for routes that only admins (store team) can access.
5. Views Setup
We will use Blade templates (Laravel’s templating engine) for building the UI pages. The views will be organized for two user groups: admins (store staff) and customers. Using the layouts provided by Breeze as a base (which includes a basic Tailwind CSS design), we will create pages for each feature:
•	Admin Interfaces:
o	Product Management Views:
	products/index.blade.php – displays a table of products with columns like Name, Price, Supplier, Stock, and action buttons (Edit, Delete). Admins can click "Add Product" to go to the create form.
	products/create.blade.php and products/edit.blade.php – forms to add or edit product info (with fields for name, description, price, supplier dropdown, etc.).
o	Order Management Views (Admin):
	orders/index.blade.php – table of all orders. Columns: Order #, Customer, Date, Status, Total. Possibly with filters (by status or customer). Each row can link to view details.
	orders/show.blade.php – detailed view of a single order: listing each OrderItem (product name, quantity, price), totals, customer info, status, and controls to update status or add tracking info. If integrated with supplier, could show supplier status for each item.
	(If needed, orders/edit.blade.php for editing an order or updating status, though simple status updates might be done via a form on the show page itself.)
o	Supplier Views:
	suppliers/index.blade.php – list of suppliers (Name, Contact, perhaps a status if we sync). Could show number of products from each supplier.
	suppliers/create.blade.php & suppliers/edit.blade.php – forms to add/edit supplier info.
	Optionally, suppliers/show.blade.php – to see supplier details and related products.
o	Customer Management (Admin) Views:
	customers/index.blade.php – list all customers (name, email, number of orders, etc.).
	customers/show.blade.php – view details of a customer account, perhaps including recent orders or the ability to reset password/send invite (some admin interfaces allow that).
	(We might reuse the users table data, so this is essentially an admin view of the users.)
These admin views can share a sidebar or navigation (e.g., links to Products, Orders, Suppliers, Customers). We’ll likely create a Blade layout like layouts/admin.blade.php and extend it for these pages, to keep a consistent admin UI.
•	Customer (Self-Service) Interfaces:
o	Dashboard: After login, a customer sees a dashboard (Breeze by default might show a simple welcome page). We will customize it to show an overview: e.g., “Hello [Name]” and a summary of their recent orders or profile info.
o	Order History: A page (orders/index but for customer context) that lists that customer’s orders. We can reuse the orders.index view but filter data. Or have logic in the controller to use the same view with different data. Each listed order links to:
o	Order Details: (orders/show for customer) – showing the items, status, and any tracking info for that order.
o	Profile Management: Breeze includes a profile page (if enabled) where user can update their name, email, and password. We’ll ensure this is accessible to customers so they can self-manage their info.
o	(Product browsing: If this CRM doubles as the storefront, we’d also have product catalog pages and a cart/checkout. However, the prompt focuses on CRM, so we assume the actual online store frontend might be separate. The CRM could still allow admins to impersonate a customer or place an order for a customer, but we won’t detail a full storefront here.)
We will utilize Blade components where appropriate for repetitive elements (like form inputs or modals for confirmation). We also ensure that the views are responsive (Tailwind CSS from Breeze helps with that) and accessible.
Example Blade Snippet – Orders Table (Admin):
blade
CopyEdit
<!-- resources/views/orders/index.blade.php -->
@extends('layouts.admin')

@section('content')
<h1 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Orders</h1>
<table class="min-w-full bg-white">
  <thead class="bg-gray-100">
    <tr>
      <th class="px-4 py-2">Order #</th>
      <th class="px-4 py-2">Customer</th>
      <th class="px-4 py-2">Date</th>
      <th class="px-4 py-2">Status</th>
      <th class="px-4 py-2">Total</th>
      <th class="px-4 py-2">Actions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    @foreach($orders as $order)
      <tr class="border-b">
        <td class="px-4 py-2">{{ $order->id }}</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2">{{ $order->user->name }}</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2">{{ $order->order_date->format('Y-m-d') }}</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2">{{ $order->status }}</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2">${{ number_format($order->total_amount, 2) }}</td>
        <td class="px-4 py-2">
          <a href="{{ route('orders.show', $order) }}" class="text-blue-600">View</a>
          <!-- Possibly Edit/Cancel actions here -->
        </td>
      </tr>
    @endforeach
  </tbody>
</table>
@endsection
This snippet generates a simple table of orders. We would create similar views for products, suppliers, etc., using tables or forms as needed. The Blade templates will leverage data passed in by controllers and use relationships (like $order->user->name or looping $order->orderItems in the order detail view).
6. Routes Definition
Routing will be set up in Laravel’s routes/web.php (for web interface routes). We will define routes for each controller and use route groups to apply middleware for authentication and admin authorization.
First, we include the default auth routes provided by Breeze (these are usually in routes/auth.php which is included by the framework – they cover login, register, password reset, etc.). Then, we define our application routes. For clarity, we’ll use Laravel’s resource controllers where appropriate, as they automatically map standard CRUD URLs to controller actions.
Auth Middleware: All CRM routes (except login/register) should require the user to be authenticated. We’ll use the auth middleware to enforce this. Breeze already registers a route for /dashboard with auth middleware as an example.
Admin Middleware: We will create a custom middleware (e.g., AdminMiddleware) to check if auth()->user()->is_admin (or role == admin). This will protect admin-only sections. We register this middleware in app/Http/Kernel.php (e.g., 'admin' => \App\Http\Middleware\AdminMiddleware::class) so we can use it in routes.
Now, route definitions might look like:
php
CopyEdit
<?php
use App\Http\Controllers\ProductController;
use App\Http\Controllers\OrderController;
use App\Http\Controllers\SupplierController;
use App\Http\Controllers\CustomerController;

Route::middleware(['auth'])->group(function() {
    // Dashboard - accessible to all logged-in users
    Route::get('/dashboard', function () {
        // return view or controller that shows different content based on role
        return view('dashboard');
    })->name('dashboard');

    // Customer self-service routes (must be logged in, but not necessarily admin)
    Route::get('/my-orders', [OrderController::class, 'index'])
         ->name('orders.my')->middleware('verified');
    Route::get('/orders/{order}', [OrderController::class, 'show'])
         ->name('orders.show')->middleware('can:view,order');
    // The above assumes a policy 'view' on Order to allow customers to view their own.

    // Group admin-only routes
    Route::middleware('admin')->group(function() {
        // Resource routes for management
        Route::resource('products', ProductController::class);
        Route::resource('suppliers', SupplierController::class);
        Route::resource('customers', CustomerController::class)->only(['index','show','edit','update','destroy']);
        Route::resource('orders', OrderController::class)->only(['index','show','edit','update']);
        // The orders.index here would list all orders for admin, distinct from the /my-orders route.
    });
});
In the snippet above:
•	We protect everything with auth first (so only logged in users can reach them).
•	We define some routes outside the admin group for general authenticated users (for example, viewing their own orders).
•	We then nest an admin middleware group for all admin-only routes, including full resource controllers for products, suppliers, etc. Resource routes automatically create conventional URLs:
o	Products: /products (GET index, POST store), /products/create, /products/{id} (GET show), /products/{id}/edit, PUT/PATCH /products/{id}, DELETE /products/{id}.
o	Similarly for suppliers and customers.
•	We limit some resource controllers with ->only([...]) if certain actions are not needed.
We will use route model binding for convenience (e.g., OrderController@show will directly receive an Order model instance for the {order} parameter). Also, for security, we might use policies: e.g., define an OrderPolicy that ensures a user can only view an order if they are admin or that order’s owner – Laravel's can:view,order middleware as in the example can enforce that via policy.
Additionally, if we plan an API or external integration, we might add routes in routes/api.php for any JSON endpoints, but that’s optional if this CRM is mostly internal and web-based. For example, an API route could allow a supplier’s system to callback updates (like sending tracking info to an endpoint we define).
With routes in place, navigating to the CRM sections will call the respective controller methods and render the Blade views we created, completing the MVC flow for our application.
Testing and Deployment Plan
Building a robust system requires testing and a careful deployment strategy. Below is the plan for verifying quality and deploying the CRM system:
•	Automated Testing Strategy: We will implement both automated feature tests and browser tests to cover the system’s functionality.
o	Feature Tests: These are functional tests that simulate HTTP requests and verify responses (using Laravel’s built-in testing with PHPUnit or Pest). For example, we will write tests to ensure an admin can create a product, a customer cannot access admin routes, an order is correctly created in the database when the OrderController@store is called, etc. Laravel supports feature tests out of the box
laravel.com
. We will use factories to generate dummy data for users, products, etc., and assert expected outcomes (e.g., after creating an order via a POST request, the database has the record and the response redirects appropriately).
o	Browser Tests: Using Laravel Dusk (a browser automation tool) we will simulate real user interactions in a browser. Laravel Dusk provides an easy-to-use API for driving a headless Chrome browser
laravel.com
. We will write Dusk tests for critical user journeys, such as:
	Admin login, navigating to the Products page, creating a new product via the form, and seeing it appear in the list.
	Customer login, viewing their orders page, and verifying that they only see their orders.
	Perhaps a full flow: customer places an order (if we have a UI for that), and then admin processes it. Dusk will help catch any JavaScript or front-end issues since it runs a real browser. (We will configure Dusk to work with Sail – Laravel documentation provides guidance for running Dusk in a Sail (Docker) environment
laravel.com
.)
o	Database Seeders for Testing: We will utilize Laravel’s seeding capability to populate test data. Laravel allows seeding the database with seed classes
laravel.com
. We will create seeders for basic data (e.g., a few suppliers and products) that can be reused in both local development and in tests (by seeding the test database). For example, a DatabaseSeeder could call SupplierSeeder and ProductSeeder to insert sample suppliers and products. This ensures we have predictable data to test against (e.g., known product names or stock levels to assert against in tests).
•	Manual Testing & QA: In addition to automated tests, the team will conduct manual testing. This includes:
o	Logging in as an admin and exercising all features (creating/editing listings, placing test orders, simulating supplier sync) to ensure the UI works as expected.
o	Testing as a customer user to verify they cannot access admin pages and that their views (order history, profile) work correctly.
o	If possible, involve a few end users or stakeholders in UAT (User Acceptance Testing) on a staging environment (see below) to get feedback on usability.
•	Staging Environment: Before full production release, we will deploy the application to a staging server. This staging environment will mirror production as closely as possible (same Docker setup or PHP version, similar database). We will:
o	Use a copy of production configuration (but maybe against a test database) on the staging server.
o	Run database migrations and seeders to set up initial data.
o	Allow the store team to do final acceptance tests here, and possibly try a trial run of a supplier integration (without affecting real supplier data if applicable).
o	Any issues found on staging can be addressed before going to production.
•	Deployment to Production: For deployment, since we used Sail (which is essentially Docker Compose), one approach is to use the same Docker setup in production. We can deploy the Docker Compose stack to a production server. Alternatively, we can deploy the Laravel app on a traditional LAMP server or a platform like Laravel Forge or Vapor. The key steps for deployment:
1.	Setup Server Environment: Provision a server with Docker (if using Sail in prod) or with PHP runtime, database, etc. Ensure environment variables (.env values) are set for production (with secure values and pointing to production DB, etc.).
2.	Code Deployment: Use Git to push code to the server or a CI/CD pipeline. For example, push to the main branch triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the Docker images and deploys them.
3.	Run Migrations and Seeders: On the production server, run php artisan migrate --force to apply migrations. Seeders can be run if we need initial admin user or essential data (careful with seeding in production – usually we only seed non-essential test data in dev, but we might seed something like an initial admin account).
4.	Build Frontend Assets: Ensure that the compiled CSS/JS (from Laravel Mix/Vite) is up to date. In CI/CD, run npm ci && npm run build and deploy the output, or use Laravel's asset build tools on the server.
5.	Cache Optimization: In production, run php artisan config:cache and php artisan route:cache for performance (if environment is stable).
6.	Verification: After deployment, do a quick smoke test on the production site – log in, open key pages – to confirm all is well.
•	Performance and Monitoring: Once live, we will monitor the application’s performance and error logs. Tools like Laravel Telescope or external monitoring (Sentry, etc.) can be enabled to catch exceptions or performance bottlenecks. Given Sail includes a Redis service, we could later utilize Redis for caching frequently accessed data (like product lists) if performance needs tuning.
•	Feedback and Continuous Improvement: The project does not end at deployment. We will collect feedback from the store team and customers using the CRM. If certain features are not user-friendly or if new needs arise (e.g., additional reports or a bulk import feature), we will plan iterative improvements. Also, based on real usage, we might adjust workflows – for example, if the supplier integration (TecCom-inspired) reveals the need for more automation, we’ll add scheduled tasks (Laravel Scheduler via cron inside Sail) to automatically sync or update orders. We will schedule regular reviews of system metrics (order processing time, error rates, etc.) and make adjustments accordingly.
By following this testing and deployment plan, we aim to deliver a high-quality CRM system with minimal bugs and a smooth rollout. The combination of automated tests (feature tests for logic, Dusk for UI)
laravel.com
and a staging phase will ensure that the “Design and Implementation of a Technological Solution for an Online Store” using Laravel Sail is successful and meets the project objectives. The result will be a robust CRM platform empowering the online store to manage customers, orders, and supplier interactions efficiently.
